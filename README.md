# kitchen-cli

kitchen-cli is a simple and very basic version control software inside your command line embedded as a "cooking simulator".

The following analogies are used by kitchen-cli :

*  kitchen     -> Your project folder
*  table       -> A folder where you dump your ingredients
*  freezer     -> A folder where you store your pastries
*  ingredients -> Your project files used to update your kitchen
*  pastries    -> Your update files archived as a tarball
*  recipe      -> Config file used by your oven to cook your pastries
*  blueprint   -> A complete backup of your kitchen
